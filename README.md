## Introduction and Purpose
Hey, welcome to my personal website, or at least, my first one. The purpose of this project is to get the hang of basic web development. Here, I'll be testing out some things, hopefully learning a ton along the way.

## Technology Used (So far)
* HTML
* CSS

## Plans for later
* Incoporate JavaScript to have some functionality. React, Vue
* Make the site look pretty; Get some good color palettes going
